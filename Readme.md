These are the starting files used by [iObedson] to create a personal blog site for the [Naija37] DevProjects Challenge, Create a fast and secure blog using MERN STACK. You are free to use them however you want to get started with the challenge, if you'd like to start working on creating the site without worrying about the content itself.

The styling of the pages is already complete. That said, the `design-files` folder contains both a Figma file, and .jpg of a design if you want to try to build it from scratch. You do not need to use this design at all either, it depends on how you wish to approach the challenge.

The `Backend` folder contains files so that you can get your project up and running without worrying about content for posts/articles. That folder contains:

- Backend Folder
  - `cloud` folder
  - `controllers` folder
  - `db` folder
  - `middlewares` folder
  - `models` folder
  - `routers` folder
  - `app.js` file
  - `package-lock.json` file
  - `package.json` file




## DevProjects Challenge

As mentioned, these files are here to help get started with a DevProjects challenge. Please visit the [challenge page](#) to learn more about the challenge.
